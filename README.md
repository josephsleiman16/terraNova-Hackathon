Project completed during the January 2020 terra_Nova Hackathon to analyse atmospheric gas data collected by ESA's Sentinel satellite fleet. Used this data to investigate the 2020 Australian bushfire crisis and propose a potential solution (FlarePro) to track the wildfires using the gas data and an R script. 

Produced a GIF tracking the wildfires across Australia.

Won best solution to a UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).
